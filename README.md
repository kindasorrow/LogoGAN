<h1>Logo Generation</h1>
<span>My first NN project, written in Google Colab, to generate logos of size 32x32.</span>
</br>
So far, only some of the files are in the repository, it is being expanded. It is also planned to adapt the files for Jupiter.
The file is currently in the repository <a href='https://github.com/kindasorrow/LogoGAN/blob/main/LogoGAN/BlueLogoSorting.ipynb'>BlueLogoSorting.ipynb</a> that selects logos by color. The name and structure is subject to change.
